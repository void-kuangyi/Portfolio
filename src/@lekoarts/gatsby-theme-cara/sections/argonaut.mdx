# Argonaut

<Text>
Argonaut is a micro frontend framework with run-time integration, providing a set
of container/shell capabilities and infrastructure, that makes it faster and easier
for teams to integrate their product experiences into the www.realestate.com.au web
app.

<br />
I worked in the web architecture team in REA Group as a software developer for three years. The main project is in developing the micro frontend framework Argonaut. I deep dived into the architecture of frontend structures, developed the platform features with typescript, wrote documentations/guidelines, communicated with other teams on the platform features/updates.
