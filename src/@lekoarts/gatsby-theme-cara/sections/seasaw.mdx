<Text title="Background">
  According to an earlier survey I conducted among young adults, among 77
  responses, 3 in 10 people find cooking themselves extremely difficult when
  they first moved out family. And 92.8% people agree that “Being involved in
  the kitchen at a young age would make me loving cooking more” and 59.8%
  participants wish “my family could teach me cooking more when I was young”.
  Unable to cook themselves is a big barrier for young adults to become
  independent.
  <br />
  This project focuses on "How can i design playful experience to encourage
  children more involved in the kitchen, in order to prepare them for future
  independence?"

  <h3>Design Principles</h3>
</Title>

<Text title="Controlled Risk">
  The current market is filled up with overly safe kitchen toys rather than
  actual kids-safe knife because knife is generally considered dangerous and
  should not be touched by children.
  <br /> <br />
  However, If children are presented with risky items with a serious functional
  purpose, they will conduct more cautiously, conduct more experimentation, and
  gain more confidence and independence than overly safe items. We should focus
  on designing for children "as safe as needed" rather than "as safe as
  possible" (Brussoni et al., 2012)

<Text title="Embodied Movement">
  <img src="../../../seasaw/Process8.png" />
  Many cultures involve their whole body when cooking. For example, chinese grind
  soybeans with the millstone, indians cook their naan with a big stove, italian
  spread tomato paste on table to wait them dry. This project focuses on engaging
  children in cooking with their whole body, like they are dancing with the food.
  It also comes from the consideration that children don't have the fine motor skills
  to control a knife yet.
