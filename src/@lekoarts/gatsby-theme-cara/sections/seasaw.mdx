<h4>Background</h4>
<Text>
  According to an earlier survey I conducted among young adults, among 77
  responses, 3 in 10 people find cooking themselves extremely difficult when
  they first moved out family. And 92.8% people agree that “Being involved in
  the kitchen at a young age would make me loving cooking more” and 59.8%
  participants wish “my family could teach me cooking more when I was young”.
  Unable to cook themselves is a big barrier for young adults to become
  independent.
  <br />
  <br />
  This project focuses on <b>
    "how to encourages children more involved in the kitchen, in order to
    prepare them for future independence"
  </b>
</Text>

<Title>
  <h4>Design Principles</h4>
</Title>
<Text title="Controlled Risk: as safe as needed">
  If children are presented with risky items with a serious functional purpose,
  they will conduct more cautiously, conduct more experimentation, and gain more
  confidence and independence than overly safe items. We should focus on
  designing for children "as safe as needed" rather than "as safe as possible"
  (Brussoni et al., 2012)
</Text>

<Text title="Embodied Movement: dance with food">
  This project focuses on engaging children in cooking with their whole body,
  like they are dancing with the food. It also comes from the consideration that
  children don't have the fine motor skills to control a knife yet.

  <h3>Testing</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  I collaborated with
  <a href="https://nicolaikultur.dk/for-born/"> Nicolai for børn</a>, a cultural
  child center in Kolding, for user testing. To help participants better understand
  the session, a poster, a info flyer and consent forms in Danish or English were
  prepared.
  <br /> <br />

  <Annotation>A poster for children</Annotation>
  <img src="../../../seasaw/info-flyer.png" />
  <Annotation>An information flyer for parents</Annotation>
  <img src="../../../seasaw/test1.JPG" />
  <Annotation>The set up for the session</Annotation>
  In total, seven children, from 4 - 8 years old, interacted with SeaSaw. After their
  interaction, I interviewed their parents and got feedbacks for the next iteration.
