    <h5>Background</h5>
According to an earlier survey I conducted among young adults, among 77
  responses, 3 in 10 people find cooking themselves extremely difficult when
  they first moved out family. And 92.8% people agree that “Being involved in
  the kitchen at a young age would make me loving cooking more” and 59.8%
  participants wish “my family could teach me cooking more when I was young”.
  Unable to cook themselves is a big barrier for young adults to become
  independent.

  <br />
  This project focuses on "How can i design playful experience to encourage
  children more involved in the kitchen, in order to prepare them for future
  independence?"

### Design Principles

#### Controlled Risk

The current market is filled up with overly safe kitchen toys rather than actual kids-safe knife because knife is generally considered dangerous and should not be touched by children.

However, If children are presented with risky items with a serious functional purpose,
they will conduct more cautiously, conduct more experimentation, and gain more confidence
and independence than overly safe items. We should focus on design for children "as
safe as needed" rather than "as safe as possible" (Brussoni et al., 2012)

#### Embodied Movement
