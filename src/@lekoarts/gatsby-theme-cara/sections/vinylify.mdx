# Vinylify

<Gap margin={400} />
<Text title="Introduction">
  Smart technology is increasingly taking over our lives. More household tasks
  become automated via the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these smart
  technologies become less personal. When the world of IoT expands rapidly, some
  retro-tech artefacts, like vinyl, are still being used and appreciated today.
  This design research study aims to reintroduce beloved features from retro
  tech into more advanced technology to review if personality, sense of
  ownership and experience can be improved.

<Text title="Methods">
  We started with interviewing with vinyl and book lovers to understand the
  appealing attributes of oldthings. The two main integrated aspects into the
  prototype are embodied interaction and personality.

  The prototype resembles a phone cover used as a portable vinyl player.

Users
  can share, collect and trade specialised records embedded with NFC tags
  linking the album.

 When playing music through Vinylify, the phone becomes the
  player and can no longer be used by the user.

7 days diary study were
conducted with participants, followed by a final interview that compares
experience with a modern music player.

  <h3>Results</h3>

<Text>
  Our study provides validation that reintroducing retro tech features in smart
  technology could improve sense of personality and user experience.
  Additionally, the prototype shows the positives of slow-tech.

<Text title="Improving smart tech">
  The rich interaction elements from retro vinyl player enhanced participants’
  music experience as well as the relationship between people and product,
  because the interactions with the product usually indicate the beginning of a
  music experience, and eventually it turns into a ritual. Apart from music
  experience, the collection of albums provides people a sense of ownership
  because of the personalisation aspects in the vinyl records.

<Text title="Including slow-tech">
  The interactive user experience of Vinylify can be linked with two important
  slow technology design principles, Ritual and Reveal. People have a rich
  interaction experience because of the appearance and operation of Vinylify,
  like the rolling mini vinyl and the functional small needle. Instead of
  clicking a button to start listening or navigate through different playlists,
  Vinylify requires a set of manual actions to start a tangible process, similar
  as the vinyl player [Grosse-Hering et al, 2013] Prioritising engagement over
  utility is one of the most important aspects of slow technology, which is the
  also missing piece of the excessively smart technology nowadays. The
  popularity of vintage products, like vinyl record players, is due to the
  factor that they provide users a sense of engagement and personal value
  through rich interaction. With the simplified operation of over smart
  products, people lost the self-exploration part. This is a limitation of smart
  technology, but it is also an opportunity. When more elements, that provide
  users with a sense of engagement and rich experience, are integrated in smart
  products, they will be smart and give users enough opportunities for
  self-exploration simultaneously.
