<Text title="Rich interaction, ownership, and rituality improves smart tech">
  The rich interaction elements from retro vinyl player enhanced participantsâ€™
  music experience as well as the relationship between people and product. The
  interaction with the product indicates the beginning of a music experience,
  and eventually turns into a ritual. The collection of albums provides people
  sense of ownership because of the personalisation aspects in the vinyl
  records.

<Text title="Consider slow-tech design principles: ritual and reveal">
  The interactive user experience of Vinylify can be linked with two important
  slow technology design principles, Ritual and Reveal. Instead of clicking a
  button to start listening, Vinylify requires a set of manual actions to start
  a tangible process. Prioritising engagement over utility is one of the most
  important aspects of slow technology, which is the also missing piece of the
  excessively smart technology nowadays. With the simplified operation of over smart products, people lost the self-exploration part. This is a limitation of smart technology, but also an opportunity. When more elements, that provide users with a sense of engagement and rich experience, are integrated in smart products, they will be smart and give users enough opportunities for self-exploration simultaneously.
