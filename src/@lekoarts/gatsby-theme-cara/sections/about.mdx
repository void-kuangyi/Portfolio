<summary><strong>Past </strong></summary>
 I am Kuangyi (27-year-old), from Nanjing, China. In 2015, I moved to
  Australia where I successfully completed my Bachelor's degree in Information
  Technology from <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">The Australian National University</a>. Then I moved to Melbourne
  where I worked for 4 years 
  as a software developer and associate UX/UI designer at a <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/">leading IT
  corporation</a>.
  <br /> <br />
 The Japanese concept of Ikigai suggests that the ideal career path aligns with
  what you love, what the world requires, what you can earn a living from, and
  what you excel at. In search of my Ikigai, I relocated to the Netherlands in
  2021 to pursue a Master's degree in Industrial Design. I selected TU/e primarily due to the vibrant design culture that the Netherlands offers. The program structure, with its emphasis on five areas of expertise, provides a comprehensive skillset that every designer should possess.
<br /> <br />
Before entering TU/e, my understanding of design was quite limited. I had a vague idea of fields I might like, such as sustainability, healthcare, social and play design but lacked a distinct design style, process, or direction of my own.
<br /> <br />
My design experience and area of expertise were also both limited. The company where I worked as a software developer supported me in undertaking a few months of design internship, which formed my foundation of practical design experience. The opportunity was offered due to my expressed interest in transitioning to design over several years. But the experience was predominantly in the commercial and UI/UX sectors. Within the professional environment, I was merely a small component of the extensive design process and had not yet independently experienced a full one. When it came to physical projects, my experience was confined to basic 3D modelling and rendering, and I lacked familiarity with material choices and the construction of real physical models.
<br /> <br />
Despite having a robust background in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), I lacked systematic instruction that would enable me to integrate my specialist knowledge into my design process.
<br /> <br />
Nonetheless, my education at Eindhoven University of Technology facilitated the accumulation of varied experience, particularly in the areas of technology & realisation, creativity & aesthetics, and user & society. Prior to my FMP, my social designs were mainly driven by responsible design, emphasising problem-solving. For my FMP,I aimed to adopt a new design methodology, focusing on a discursive point of view. Additionally, since my two primary areas of expertise, US and MDC, were separately developed previously, I sought to merge them in my FMP.

<details close>
<summary><strong>Diverse & Empathetic </strong></summary>
Growing up in China and living, studying, and working in Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands from the age of 19 onwards, I bring a
rich intercultural perspective to my work. My varied experiences across
different fields like software engineering and UI design have allowed me to
engage with a diverse array of individuals. As a minority in the society, I
deeply empathise with those who lack resources or whose voices often go unheard,
and I've personally witnessed the profound impact of societal structures and
systems on individual growth. 
 <br /> <br />
These experiences have significantly expanded my
understanding of society and the world, enhancing my sensitivity to the
complexities and nuances in societal issues. In my inclusive design approach, I
strive to genuinely understand the circumstances of users and the societal
environment influencing them (e.g. <a href="/weave">Weave</a>). I prefer to focus on particular
social groups who occupy more vulnerable positions within the society, acknowledging their uniqueness and considering the nuances of
their situations rather than pursuing a one-size-fits-all design.
</details>
  <br />
<details close>
<summary><strong>Logical & Critical</strong></summary>
With a strong background in STEM, my systematic training in AI, big data, and
programming enables me to swiftly understand various types of technology and
integrate them into my designs for more interactive user experiences (e.g.
<a href="/nebula"> Nebula</a>). However, I believe technology is a means, not an end. My extensive
experience with technology has made me more aware that technology cannot wholly
solve human issues, or may only provide an illusion of resolution. Therefore, I
employ technology with a critical mindset, only where it truly adds value. 
 <br /> <br />
My
logical mind enables me to work on intricate problems in a structured way. I
practise an iterative approach on various levels, from the overarching design
process to individual design activity. Adept at identifying problems with
intuition, I substantiate my assumption with qualitative and quantitative data gathered
from ethnography research, as well as theory support. Through thorough
analysis, I excel at distilling clear patterns from complex data, which enables
me to truly understand the problems at a systematic level (e.g. <a href="/weave">Weave</a>). 
 <br /> <br />
My
critical mind prompts me to spot flaws and constantly probe the “why” throughout
the design process. Questions like “Why do I choose this design approach?”, “How can I validate it?” or “Why does
this occur?” often guide my exploration. I am also critical about areas for improvement and
actively seek opportunities for growth. For instance, I undertook projects at
<a href="https://www.designskolenkolding.dk/en"> Design School Kolding</a> for my M2.1 specifically to enhance my creativity and aesthetic
sensibility, and knowledge in play design.
</details>
  <br />
<details close>
<summary><strong>Playful</strong></summary>
Contrasting with my logical thinking, my design style often embodies elements
of playfulness. This playful spirit is deeply rooted in my childhood, filled
with joyful memories of unstructured play, particularly with nature. Despite
societal emphasis on academic performance, I value the implicit lessons gained
from these playful explorations. Looking back, I realise that they have
significantly contributed to my development, reinforcing my belief in the
importance of play. 
 <br /> <br />
This foundation has nurtured my inclination towards playful
expression and interest in play design. It has driven me to delve deeper into
play theory and incorporate them into various fields, including education (<a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a>),
business (<a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>), and spatial design (<a href="/flow">Flow</a>). 
 <br /> <br />
 My design form
also mirrors the spirit of play through elements of irregularity, embodiment, and conflict. My designs often involve physical interactions and encapsulate
embodiment (e.g. <a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>). Irregular shapes embody rule-breaking playfulness
(e.g. <a href="/weave">Weave</a>). Conflict aligns more with dark humour and dark play (e.g.
combining knife and children play in <a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>), which creates a memorable impact, prompting
reflection by combining unrelated domains with playfulness (e.g. exploring the relation between vulnerability and play with the <a href="/jenga">Jenga</a> project).

<Text title="Vision">
<details close>
<summary><strong> Inclusive design breaks the boundary of stereotypes and opens up space for nuances and growth</strong></summary>
Based on my experiences and reflections, I've come to believe that many social designs remain rooted in self-assumptions about users, such as blind people are incapable of international travels by themselves. This is a pitfall I have encountered in my own design journey. <strong>As designers, we need to embrace vulnerability - to understand, listen, and accept differences and nuances.</strong> Design should either be approached from a first-person perspective, or it should involve deep empathy towards the struggles experienced by others, including their unique sociocultural contexts. Only then we can create designs that genuinely resonate with users.
  <br /> <br />
From personal experience, I know that bias against women, ethnic minorities, the disabled, members of LGBTQI+ community, and many others still commonly occur in our current society. Lack of awareness of other groups’ realities can be the root of such bias and prejudice. <strong>Inclusive design, in my view, should challenge existing rules, shatter the boundary of preconceptions and stereotypes, demonstrate diverse possibilities, and open up space for nuance and growth.</strong> Therefore, my designs fundamentally challenge existing perceptions, whether it's society's understanding of immigrant struggles (<a href="/weave">Weave</a>), the belief that we cannot play outdoors in bad weather (<a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a>), that kitchen knives are too dangerous for children (<a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>), or that introverted children don't belong in amusement parks (<a href="/flow">Flow</a>). Through my designs, I seek to present various facets of issues, showcase broad possibilities, provide tools for people to foster their growth, and ultimately broaden societal perceptions to create a more inclusive society.
<br /> <br />
I also believe in the power of playful design, which I often integrate with other fields. Much like how stand-up comedy uses humour to critique, such combinations not only challenge our perceptions but also spark critical reflection on reality.
<br /> <br />
This vision of challenging and reshaping societal perceptions through inclusive and playful design guides my professional identity and decision-making. It serves as my long-term perspective and resonates with my background, values and beliefs. As I continue to develop competencies in design, this vision will provide the anchor point that directs my growth and learning.

      <strong>Creativity & Aesthetics</strong>
    </summary>
<strong>Materiality</strong>: I acquired skills in handling a variety of materials such as textiles, metal, acrylic, paper, and clay, while specialising in wood (specifically MDF, pine, and balsa wood) and Polylactic acid (PLA). I became adept in using specific tools required for each material, learning techniques such as forming, processing, and polishing. This involved equipment such as the CNC machine, jigsaw, sewing machine, sanding machine, and embroidery machine, and others. In FMP, a mixture of materials - including wood, PLA, acrylic, foam, metal, and yarn - were carefully selected and merged to optimise the presentation of the final product. 
<br /> <br />
<strong>Ideas generating, refining and selecting</strong>: 
The technique learned from the course <i>Exploratory Sketching</i> was used in visually generating my ideas. Rapid prototyping with materials like foam, paper, or MDF was employed to refine the forms and shapes, aiding in making informed final design decisions. Numerous evaluation methodologies were used to select the best ideas, for instance, a spider web evaluation graph which considers diverse aspects such as user interaction, feasibility, and playfulness. Furthermore, user tests and interviews were also conducted to examine the design's user interaction capabilities, leading to further enhancements.
<br /> <br />
<strong>Storytelling and presenting</strong>: 
My ability to present ideas evolved significantly, with a focus on enhancing visual communication and storytelling. I sought guidance from my peers in communication design at DSKD. They introduced me to the effective utilisation of Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, equipping me to create visually appealing presentations that tell the design story.
<br /> <br />
<strong>
  Link to professional skills, other expertise areas and design research process
</strong>
<br /> 
Understanding the properties and potential of different materials broadens the scope
of design possibilities, enhancing the overall user experience. The enhancement of
my storytelling and presentation skills, coupled with my idea generation, refinement,
and selection capabilities, has streamlined my design process. It has enabled me
to swiftly transform my design ideas into tangible sketches or prototypes that effectively
tell a coherent story. This efficiency also provides a faster feedback loop with users
or stakeholders, aiding me in determining the subsequent steps in the design process. <br /> <br />
The
fusion of creativity and aesthetics with technology and realisation, such as 3D modelling
and Arduinos, has been my key strategy. For instance, in the development of Weave,
I found that users are more likely to engage with a design product when it achieves
a certain level of interactivity and aesthetic appeal. It is only through a willingness
to interact that societal perspectives can be potentially expanded through the design,
contributing towards a more inclusive society.

    <strong>Technology & Realisation</strong>
  </summary>
  <strong>Electronic Engineering</strong>: Through the<a href="/nebula"> Nebula</a> project, I accumulated
  hands-on experience in designing a sophisticated electronic system, involving integrating
  various components such as compass, GPS, vibration actuators, and arduino
  into a unified navigational system. Additionally, practical skills such as soldering
  and assembling were further developed. The project <a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a> facilitated
  the enhancement of my technical knowledge, specifically in aerodynamics. Electronics
  (a motor, potentiometer, bluetooth) were combined with the principles of aerodynamics to
  develop a Lego paraglider.
  <br /> <br />
  <strong>Technical Drawing & 3D modelling</strong>: I learned the importance of technical drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed. These not only serve as references for further 3D modelling, but also assist in evaluating their feasibility and facilitating feedback from engineers. I also took advantage of the intensive Rhino and Keyshot workshop at DSKD to develop my 3D modelling and rendering skills. These skills are invaluable for detailing technical aspects of a design, as well as creating rapid physical prototypes with tools such as a 3D printer or laser cutter.
  <br /> <br />
  <strong>
   Link to professional skills and other expertise areas
  </strong> <br />
  Working with technology in a design context has made me realise that when technology does not perform as expected, it is important to seek alternatives, instead of solely troubleshooting the technological issues,. From a lesson learnt from <a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a>, I understood the value of managing potential risks and thoroughly understanding the pros and cons of a technology before the adoption. It was a valuable lesson on how an overly engineering-centric approach could potentially hinder a design project.
    <br /> <br />
My technology and realisation skills are closely interwoven with my maths data computing background. Leveraging my programming expertise, I possess the proficiency to write code for complex tasks within electronic systems. Meanwhile, my skills in creativity and aesthetics allow me to elevate the product beyond mere engineering, transforming it into an appealing and interactive design project.

    <strong>Maths, Data & Computing</strong>
  </summary>
  My foundational knowledge in maths, data, and computing was primarily developed during my undergraduate studies and professional work experience. The subsequent reflection focuses on how I integrated this knowledge with other expertise areas.
    <br /> <br />
  <strong>Integration with User and Society</strong>: Data is often viewed as predominantly digital. My FMP, <a href="/weave">Weave</a>, explored the power of data in a distinct way by transforming data into a tangible and physical manifestation, combined with the realisation skills. Data infused with social meaning enhances the depth and social values of data, and highlighting a societal issue through credible data fosters greater understanding of the social subject matter.
  <br /> <br />
  <strong>Integration with Business and Entrepreneurship</strong>: To assess the viability of our business idea in the course <i>Design Innovation Strategy</i>, I built and deployed a fully functional landing page on a web server, with integrated tracking logic to identify the most popular commercial deal among customers. By establishing this fully operational website, we were able to test our business concept in a real-world scenario.
<br /> <br />
<strong>Integration with Creativity and Aesthetics:
</strong> Communication design skills and computing were integrated in the <a href="/narrative">Narrative Tool</a> project, which creates UX/UI design and deploys a product to production. The design was conceptualised in Figma and  then presented to clients for feedback. Subsequently, an analytics dashboard was built into production using Javascript and CSS, with data visualisation, functional programming principles, careful selection of data formats, and the application of breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse and merge data in a tree structure. Furthermore, this interactive portfolio website was also designed and developed using Typescript and CSS. Code can be seen at my <a href="https://github.com/void-kuangyi/Portfolio">gitub repository</a>.

    <strong>User & Society</strong>
  </summary>
  <strong>User</strong>: I adopted a second-person perspective, designing for individuals with visual impairments (<a href="/nebula">Nebula</a>), and introverted children (<a href="/flow">Flow</a>). Later, in my FMP, I chose the first-person perspective, drawing on my own experiences as a foreign resident navigating the Dutch public systems. I supplemented this perspective with user research and theoretical components, enriching the mixed perspectives of the project.
<br /> <br />
<strong>User Evaluation</strong>: I experimented with a wide range of user evaluation methods, such as semi-structured interviews, surveys, diary studies, sensory ethnography research, user testing, and participatory design methodology. These practical applications allowed me to put the theory learned in the <i>User Evaluation Methods</i> course into practice and equip me to select the most suitable methodologies for diverse scenarios. To support my user research, I utilised various tools, including photo-elicitation, UX journey maps, cultural probes, and emotional wheels.
<br /> <br />
<strong>Context and Society:</strong> I developed awareness and sensitivity to the profound impact that different contexts can have on users. This understanding spans a broad spectrum, from sociocultural contexts to specific spatial and environmental settings. For instance, I explored how space influences Dutch children's interactions during play (<a href="/flow">Flow</a>). In the user testing phase of <a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>, I noted that the results, obtained from Danish children in Kolding, might differ from those involving Dutch children or even Danish children in Copenhagen. <a href="/weave">Weave</a> primarily focuses on skilled immigrants in the context of the Netherlands, demonstrating a similar contextual consideration.
<br /> <br />
<strong>Link to professional Identity, vision and design research process 
</strong><br /> With the aspiration of being an inclusive designer, users constitute a critical component of my design process. I leverage both quantitative and qualitative data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the users and their circumstances, integrating this with theoretical insights to drive the design process forward. My primary focus centres around more vulnerable demographics, aims to challenge societal stereotypes through my design work and ultimately promote a more inclusive society.
Recognising the significant role of context, I strive to authentically understand not only the individual experiences of users but also their wider societal environment. I prioritise depth over breadth, which is why I choose to concentrate on specific groups and the nuanced dynamics within their unique contexts. This approach ensures that the final design can deeply resonate with its users, sparking connections and stimulating reflection on reality.

    <strong>Design Research Process</strong>
  </summary>
  <strong>Theory based Design</strong>: The evolution of my design research process is deeply linked with my growing understanding of users and society. The knowledge I acquired about users and society was firmly rooted in research. Projects like<a href="/wind"> Flow</a>, <a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a>, and <a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a> allowed me to delve into theories related to children, education, and play. These theoretical frameworks were also instrumental in guiding my design processes, for instance, the theory of playful tension, learning through play was employed to design playful learning experiences.
  <br /> <br />
I relied on discursive design theory as a foundational approach to the design process of FMP. I also studied systematic changes and cross-cultural theories to comprehend the intricate social system. An example of such application was when I created a relation map based on conflict analysis theory.

<br /> <br />
<strong>Process</strong>: Beyond these, I have also explored and reflected on diverse
design processes to gain more control and flexibility in my approach.
<a href="/wind"> Flow</a> and <a href="/vinylify">Vinylify</a> adopted a research-through-design process, using techniques like
expert interviews and diary studies to generate insights. <a href="/seasaw">SeaSaw</a> and <a href="/weave">Weave</a> utilised
a user-centred design process involving interviews, surveys, and prototype creation
for user testing and data analysis. <a href="/jenga">Jenga</a> followed an experimental
design process, conducting social experiments to gather preliminary insights for
further research. <a href="/wind">Ride with Wind</a> adopted an engineering and realisation-centred
design process, involving multiple iterations of making, testing, refining, and integrating
technological knowledge.

My first step is to become part of a small-scale organisation or studio that resonates with my professional identity and vision, with a focus on playful or social design. This will help me gain professional experience, further develop my expertise areas and establish valuable networks. Smaller companies are my preference because my previous experiences in larger organisations have shown that smaller ones offer more responsibility, providing more learning opportunities and personal recognition.
