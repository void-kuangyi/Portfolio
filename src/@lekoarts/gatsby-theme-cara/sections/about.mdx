## About

> 1st year Master of Industrial Design student at the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. My bachelor is in software development and I worked 3.5 years as a software developer in Melbourne before. Therefore, you will see a mix of design and technology projects on this portfolio website.

I have been working with technology for many years and the lack of humanitarian and creativity focus within the programming drives me to change career to industrial design. I still enjoy programming and it has been a very useful skill for me, but social design is my focus from now on.

I am very much interested in exploring the a community's social dynamic. I have lived within different cultural and societal contexts and shifted between different social roles, which enables me to view a problem critically and connect with users on different levels. I have observed the significant impact of the environment on people. I empathise with people who lack accessibilities to opportunities because I grew up in a small town in China with limited understanding from others and I have been the minority as a queer Chinese woman in the western society. As a designer, i want my design promote a nurturing society that provides everyone equal opportunities to fully explore their potentials and live their fullest life.
