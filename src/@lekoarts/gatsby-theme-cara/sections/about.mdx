## About

Final year Industrial Design master student at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. I worked 7 years in Tech before changing my career to design. So the website has a selected mix of design and technology projects.

Quirky, queer, playful, logical, determined, international... i am a mix kid.
