##### About Kuangyi Xing

<div>
  I am an designer and an engineer, focusing on open-ended play, social
  inclusion, and data. <br />
  Through playfulness, contrast and interaction, my design often challenge preconceptions
  and stereotypes, showcase diverse possibilities, and open up space for nuances.{" "}
  <br />
  Personally, I am quirky, queer, playful, logical, and multicultured.
