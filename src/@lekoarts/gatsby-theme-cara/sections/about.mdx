## About

Final year master of Industrial Design student at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. Before changing my career to design, I worked 7 years in Technology.

My design features contrast, playfulness, interaction and embodiment.

Quirky, queer, playful, logical, determined, intercultural... i am a mix kid.
