# Story Narrative Tool

##### An interactive narrative tool to probe participant responses to design stories during clinical trial

<Gap margin={200} />

<Text>
  Stories have been used as a resource in design ever since the shift to user-
  and human-centered design. They are a great way to put user values center
  stage, and to develop technology solutions that prioritise those values.
  However, design stories and scenarios are often constructed within the design
  studio, or with a limited set of users. With an online interactive narrative
  tool, more diverse users are brought into the design process.
  <br />
  <br />
  This project aims to design and develop an interactive narrative tool to probe
  participant responses to design stories and track their activities for researchers'
  further research.
  <br />
  <br />
  This tool is part of research being conducted by{" "}

<Text title="Tracking Web">
  For researchers, participants' responses to the story is tracked with a
  dashboard.
  <br />
  <br />
  It is created with Javascript, React framework and CSS. Functional programming,{" "}
  <a href="https://d3js.org/">data visualisation library</a> and breadth-first search
  (BFS) algorithms to traverse and merge data in a tree structure were employeed.
  The dashboard is hosted on TU/e's web server. The open source code can be found
  on my <a href="https://github.com/void-kuangyi/Narrative-Tool">
    github repository.

    Figma Design for the tracking dashboard. Participants' data are represented
    in a tree structrure. Each individual pathway is illustrated or merged with
    others if they share some parts of the pathway. The circle's size indicates
    the number of participants choosing this option. Comments were also captured
    and grouped.
