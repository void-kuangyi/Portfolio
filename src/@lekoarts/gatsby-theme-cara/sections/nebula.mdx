    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    Travelling and exploring unfamiliar places is an exciting experience for most sighted people. However, for the visually impaired and blind people, this experience is often more frustrating and mentally demanding than enjoyable. They rely on tools informing them about their immediate surroundings and the other senses to grasp their environment. Nebula is an interactive belt that supports unfamiliar urban exploration for people with visual impairment. The belt translates navigational data into haptic sensation, allowing users to explore without constantly figuring out where they are going or from where they come. Nebula minimises the fear of getting lost and relieves mental strain by creating a haptic breadcrumb trail to ensure the wearer always gets home. Nebula encourages exploration while allowing the wearer to immerse in the experience and enjoy the journey.

  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  The World Health Organisation estimates that 253 million people worldwide suffer
  from visual impairment, of whom about 36 million are completely blind, and about
  217 million suffer from moderate to severe visual impairment (Bourne et al., 2017,
  as cited in Qiao et al., 2021). In the Netherlands, the number of visually impaired
  may increase by 18% to 367,000 in 2020 (Limburg & Keunen, 2009). Although visually
  impaired people undergo special training to learn specific navigation and orientation
  techniques and strategies, it has been observed that 30 % of them never leave their
  homes alone. Moreover, only a fraction of blind people travel independently to
  unknown places (Balata et al., 2015). Visual impairment primarily restricts a person’s
  mobility, which significantly reduces visually impaired people’s travel-related
  activities (Golledge et al, as cited in Balata et al., 2015), leaving a big gap
  for the tourism industry. On the contrary, a survey conducted in China shows that
  more than 60% of disabled people have a strong desire to travel, and the proportion
  of disabled people who have a desire to travel is increasing (Liu, 2016, as cited
  in Qiao et al., 2021).

  For travellers, the ultimate value of travelling is to obtain emotional
  enjoyment and delight from travel experiences (Hosany et al., 2020, as cited
  in Qiao et al., 2021). When walking in unfamiliar cities, visually impaired
  people have to constantly build a mental map of where they come from and where
  to go. The fear of getting lost restrains them from immersing in the
  surroundings and enjoying the experience. When travelling is more mentally
  demanding than positive emotional enjoyment and delight, they stop going on
  adventures even with the desire for exploration.

     <h5>Design Process</h5>
We interviewed 7 people with visually impairment from australia in a focus group, and conducted user testings with 5 visually impaired people in the Netherlands, collaborating with <a href="https://www.simondogger.nl/">Simon Dogger</a>.

The fabric part of the belt is designed to be interchangable. The products comes with comfort line and aesthetic line. Comfort line focuses on wearing under the shirt and is equipped with soft skin-friendly materials. Aesthetic line aims at showing wearer's aesthetic expression of themselves.

  By creating Nebula, we want to promote the inclusiveness of society by helping
  people with impaired vision and increasing the market volume of the tourism
  industry from filling the gap for the visually impaired. The ability to
  explore the neighbourhood independently and to travel to the desired
  destination is needed for a satisfactory level of quality of life and
  self-confidence (Balata et al., 2015). Therefore, last but not the least, we
  hope to improve the travelling sentiment of visually impaired and blind
  individuals and assist them in exploring and travelling outside their comfort
  zone, and eventually boost their quality of life and confidence.
