# Play and Vulnerability

<Gap margin={200} />
<Text title="Introduction">
  It is common to hear people downplay a serious situation, e.g. cancer or
  scars, or jokingly talk about death or trauma in front of others. If downplay
  is also a play behaviour, does the play create a safe place for vulnerability?
  Can play allow for people to unconsciously let go of emotional baggage and
  therefore be used as a method to more easily invite vulnerability?
  <br /> <br />
  This project collaborated with Pratt institute, New York. I paired with
  another design student from Pratt and conducted play-inspired experimentations
  over six weeks. Design for vulnerability means placing a person in front of
  the other by designing a situation, process, structure, product, or service
  that enables or—at least—does not prevent this possibility from happening
  (Cipolla, 2018).

<Text title="Jenga">
  Inspired by a conversation that Jenga is the most popular sensory toy at my
  friend's therapy session with children who have traumatic background, we
  developed Jenga questions and stamps.
  <br /> <br />
  Jenga questions focuses on sharing of stories, explores emotional
  vulnerability through verbal communication. It is direct and Interactive.
  <br /> <br />
  Jenga stamps focuses on touch sensation. It explores physical vulnerability
  through non-verbal communication. It is Implicit & Indirect.

<Text title="Vulnerability">
  There are different vulnerable levels in our experiments. In Jenga Questions,
  1st level has the most vulnerable questions like “Who was the first person you
  loved and lost?”, and 2nd level example questions are "What do you see as your
  best quality?", while 3rd is the least vulnerable, like "What super power
  would you want?".

  <br /> <br />
  In the Jenga Stamp experiment, body parts have different vulnerable levels .
  The hands and arms are usually the least vulnerable. Shoulders, face, ankles,
  calf are expected to be more sensitive. The most vulnerable part are usually
  the areas that are always covered by clothes.

<Text title="Experiment">
  We experimented with 10 acquaintances, 2 strangers and 6 intimates, including
  couples, mom and son, also close friends. We discovered the existence of
  several phases during the experiment, which we named them discomfort,
  engaging, Intimacy, euphoria, fantasy play and fellowship. The experiments
  were also conducted in different contexts, including schools, park, home and
  climbing gyms.
  <br /> <br />
  Discomfort usually happens at the start of the experiments. People were
  confused “Why do we want to stamp each other”, or refused to stamp or got
  really nervous so i have to use paper to resemble their skin. Some got over
  the discomfort stage and became more engaging while some remained.
