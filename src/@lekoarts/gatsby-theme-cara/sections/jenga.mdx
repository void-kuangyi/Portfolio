# Play and Vulnerability

<h5>An exploration of play, vulnerability and intimacy</h5>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  It is common to hear people downplay a serious situation, e.g. cancer or
  scars, or jokingly talk about death or trauma in front of others.
  Vulnerability is the feeling of being exposed and unable to withstand the
  effects of a hostile environment (Cipolla, 2018).{" "}
  <b>
    If downplay is a play behaviour, does play create a safe place for
    vulnerability? Does play allow people unconsciously let go of emotional
    baggage? Can play be used as a method to invite vulnerability more easily?
  </b>
  <br />
  This project collaborated with Pratt institute, New York. I was paired with a
  communication design student from Pratt and conducted play-inspired
  experimentations over 6 weeks. The jenga stamp experiments are predominantly
  conducted by me.

  <h3>Jenga Questions and Stamps</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  Inspired by a conversation with my friend, Jenga is the most popular sensory
  toy at her therapy session with children who have traumatic background. We
  developed Jenga questions and stamps.

  Jenga questions. Focus on sharing of stories, explores emotional vulnerability
  through verbal communication. Direct and Interactive.

  <h3>Experiments</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  We experimented with <b>10 acquaintances, 2 strangers and 6 intimates</b>.
  People were invited to play jenga questions or stamps.

  <h3>Insights</h3>
</Title>
We discovered existence of several phases during the experiment.

<Text title="Discomfort">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/discomfort.jpg">
    usually happens at the start of the experiments. People were confused “Why
    do we want to stamp each other”, or refused to stamp or got really nervous.
    Some got over the discomfort stage and became more engaging while some
    remained.
  </ImageText>
</Text>

<Text title="Engaging">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/engaging.jpg">
    Some people immediately engaged in the game and stamped on my face while
    some became involved after few rounds.
  </ImageText>
</Text>

<Text title="Fantasy Play">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/fantasy.jpg">
    The open-ended patterns of Jenga Stamp fostered fantasy play in the
    experiments. People get excited when they make a meaningful pattern, “Oh, a
    lollipop”, “I want to show others this is my cool tattoo”, “Your heart is
    broken” with a cupid’s arrow, “I am making you a Jewish” with Star of David.
  </ImageText>
</Text>

<Text title="Euphoria">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/euphoria.jpg">
    Euphoria is defined as a type of play mood characterised by an intense
    expectation of silliness in the research from Karoff (2013). It happens when
    Jenga tower collapse. Some people laughed crazily while some were annoyed at
    losing the game, some were scared or shocked of the collapse.
  </ImageText>
</Text>

<Text title="Intimacy">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/intimacy.jpg">
    Couples, close friends usually go straight to each other’s face at the first
    round. There were more laughter, cheeky moves during the play. Intimate
    people also stamped more on vulnerable areas like eyelid, cheeks, belly and
    etc.
  </ImageText>
</Text>

<Text title="Fellowship">
  <ImageText src="../../../jenga/fellowship.jpg">
    The sense of fellowship was formed at the end of the experiments. People
    took selfies, said “Ohhh, we have the similar patterns” when both of us
    coincidently had a moon shape below a circle, or expressed that we shared a
    tattooing experience together.

<Text title="Vulnerability and Intimacy">
  <img src="../../../jenga/vulnerable-levels.png" />
  <br /> <br />
  <b> There are different vulnerable levels in our body parts.</b> In the Jenga
  Stamp experiment, hands and arms are usually the least vulnerable. Shoulders,
  face, ankles, calf are expected to be more sensitive. The most vulnerable part
  are usually the areas that are always covered by clothes. <br />
  <br />
  Being vulnerable is uncomfortable and is especially amplified when talking to
  strangers. <b>When the intimacy increases, the vulnerability decreases.</b>
  The discomfort phase does not exist when intimate people play with each other.
  We inferred that because intimate people have already been comfortable with each
  other and the game is not at a level that makes them feel vulnerable.
  <br /> <br />
  We also observed different reactions in different social or spatial contexts. People
  are less likely to participate after a stressful class, compared to a cosy afternoon
  in the school. Skin area are less exposed in a cold park than a climbing gym, which
  influence how people react to the stamping game.
