# Play and Vulnerability

<Gap margin={200} />
<Title>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  It is common to hear people downplay a serious situation, e.g. cancer or
  scars, or jokingly talk about death or trauma in front of others.
  Vulnerability is the feeling of being exposed and unable to withstand the
  effects of a hostile environment (Cipolla, 2018). If downplay is also a play
  behaviour, does the play create a safe place for vulnerability? Can play allow
  for people to unconsciously let go of emotional baggage and therefore be used
  as a method to more easily invite vulnerability?
  <br /> <br />
  This project collaborated with Pratt institute, New York. I paired with a
  communication design student from Pratt and conducted play-inspired
  experimentations over 6 weeks.

  <h3>Jenga</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  Inspired by a conversation with my friend, a child therapist, that Jenga is
  the most popular sensory toy at her therapy session with children who have
  traumatic background, we developed Jenga questions and stamps.
  <br /> <br />
  Jenga questions. focuses on sharing of stories, explores emotional
  vulnerability through verbal communication. It is direct and Interactive.

  <Gap margin={200} />
  Jenga stamps focuses on touch sensation. It explores physical vulnerability through
  non-verbal communication. It is Implicit & Indirect.

  <h3>Vulnerability</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  There are different vulnerable levels in our experiments.
  <br /> <br />
  <img src="../../../jenga/vulnerable-levels.png" />
  <br /> <br />
  In the Jenga Stamp experiment, body parts have different vulnerable levels .
  The hands and arms are usually the least vulnerable. Shoulders, face, ankles,
  calf are expected to be more sensitive. The most vulnerable part are usually
  the areas that are always covered by clothes.

<Title>
  <h3>Experiments</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  We experimented with 10 acquaintances, 2 strangers and 6 intimates, including
  couples, mom and son, also close friends. We discovered the existence of
  several phases during the experiment.

<Text title="Discomfort">
  usually happens at the start of the experiments. People were confused “Why do
  we want to stamp each other”, or refused to stamp or got really nervous. Some
  got over the discomfort stage and became more engaging while some remained.
</Text>

<Text title="Engaging">
  Some people immediately engaged in the game and stamped on my face while some
  became involved after few rounds.
</Text>

<Text title="Fantasy Play">
  The open-ended patterns of Jenga Stamp fostered fantasy play in the
  experiments. People get excited when they make a meaningful pattern, “Oh, a
  lollipop”, “I want to show others this is my cool tattoo”, “Your heart is
  broken” with a cupid’s arrow, “I am making you a Jewish” with Star of David.
</Text>

<Text title="Euphoria">
  Euphoria is defined as a type of play mood characterised by an intense
  expectation of silliness in the research from Karoff (2013). We named this
  phase “euphoria” to indicate the intensity of emotion. It usually happens when
  Jenga tower collapse. Some people laughed crazily, some people were annoyed at
  losing the game, some were scared of the falling and some were shocked because
  of the suddenness.
</Text>

<Text title="Intimacy">
  Couples, close friends usually go straight to each other’s face at the first
  round. There were more laughter, cheeky moves during the play. Intimate people
  also stamped more on vulnerable areas like eyelid, cheeks, belly and etc.
</Text>

<Text title="Fellowship">
  The sense of fellowship was formed at the end of the experiments. People took
  selfies, said “Ohhh, we have the similar patterns” when both of us
  coincidently had a moon shape below a circle, or expressed that we shared a
  tattooing experience together.

  <h3>Insights</h3>
</Title>

<Text>
  The experiments are exploratory and the insights are based on our own
  observation and intuition from a first person perspective.
  <br /> <br />
  Being vulnerable is uncomfortable and is especially amplified when talking to
  strangers. When the intimacy increases, the vulnerability decreases. The
  discomfort phase does not exist when intimate people play with each other. We
  inferred that because intimate people have already been comfortable with each
  other and the game is not at a level that makes them feel vulnerable.
  <br /> <br />
  We also observed different reactions in different social or spatial contexts.
  People are less likely to participate after a stressful class, compared to a
  cosy afternoon in the school. Skin area are less exposed in a cold park than a
  climbing gym, which influence how people react to the stamping game.
