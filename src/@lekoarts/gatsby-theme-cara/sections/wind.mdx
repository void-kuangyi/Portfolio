  <h4>Introduction</h4>
</Title>

<Text>
  After a field trip to Lego House in Billund, Denmark, I chose their physical
  outdoor zone because I am interested in outdoor play, and also Lego house's
  outdoor zone was under development.
</Text>

<i>The outdoor zone I chose</i>

<Title>
  <h4>Design Ideas</h4>
</Title>
<h5>Play with Contrast: a play experience activated by bad weather</h5>
<Text>
  In Billund, the rain and wind are very common. I want to design a play
  experience that turns the negative weather to positivity and implicitly
  teaches children shift the way of thinking.
</Text>

<h5>Can we play when it is rainy?</h5>

<h5>Can we play when it is windy?</h5>

  <h4>Play Theory: Learning through Play</h4>

  </a> from Lego Foundation
</i>
<Text>
  After discussion with designers from Lego House and Lego Foudndation, I
  decided on the wind concept because of its uniqueness and better expected
  playful learning outcome. The children are expected to be "I am enthusiastic
  about trying this again", "I am invested", "I am deliberate about the changes
  i make", "I am developing my own understanding" and "I cooperate with others
  to initiate new play experience".
</Text>

<Title>
  <h4>Play Theory: Playful Tension</h4>
</Title>
<img src="../../../wind/tension.png" />
<i>The orderly and unruly of ride with wind play experience</i>
<Text>
  Playful tension is a theoretical concept of play design, developed by Jess
  Uhre Rahbek, that bridges the gap between play theory and play design
  practice. To assist the player in achieving playful tension, the play needs to
  bring the orderly and the unruly together.
</Text>

<Title>
  <h4>Hang Glider Design</h4>
</Title>
<Text>
  It is impossible to develop the whole play experience within the time frame.
  So I focused on developing a hang glider because the flying is the key part of
  the experience.
</Text>
<h5>1st Iteration</h5>
<img src="../../../wind/iteration1.JPG" />
<i>Basic structure of a hang glider</i>
<Text></Text>
<h5>3rd Iteration</h5>
<img src="../../../wind/iteration2.JPG" />
<i>
  Improved aerodynamic structure, wireless remote control, and improved
  materials: basal wood frame and paper wing
</i>
<Text></Text>
<h5>6th Iteration</h5>
<img src="../../../wind/iteration3.png" />
<i>
  Added propeller for longer flying experience, Improved frame material for
  robustness, Duplo brick container for electronics, More colour combinations
</i>

  <h4>Demo and Feedback</h4>
  <h5>With Lego designers</h5>
</Title>
<img src="../../../wind/demo2.jpeg" />
<Text>
  At the end of the project, I presented my prototype to 10 designers from Lego
  House and Lego Foundation and received feedbacks from different perspectives,
  like business feasibility, local legislation, design process, space management
  and etc.
