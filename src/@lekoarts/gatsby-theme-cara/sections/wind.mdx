  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  This project collaborates with
  <a href="https://legohouse.com/da-dk/"> Lego House </a>to develop a play experience
  for one of the zones. After the field trip to Lego House in Billund, Denmark, I
  chose the white zone, which is their physical outdoor space.

  <h3>Exploration</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  In Billund, the rain and wind are very common and the day gets dark early. I
  want to design a play area that plays with contrast. It is activated by the
  rain, or become playful because of the wind or the darkness. I envision the
  play experience turning the negative weather to the positiveness and teaching
  children shift the way of thinking of negativity. For my first exploration, I
  developed 20 concepts for three natural elements, rain, wind and light. After
  that i narrowed down to one concept for each natural element.
