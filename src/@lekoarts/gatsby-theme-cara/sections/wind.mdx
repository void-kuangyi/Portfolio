# Ride with Wind

<Gap margin={200} />

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  This project collaborates with
  <a href="https://legohouse.com/da-dk/"> Lego House </a>to develop a play experience
  for one of the zones. After the field trip to Lego House in Billund, Denmark, I
  chose the white zone, which is their physical outdoor space.

  <h3>Exploration</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  In Billund, the rain and wind are very common and the day gets dark early. I
  want to design a play area that plays with contrast. It is activated by the
  rain, or become playful because of the wind or the darkness. I envision the
  play experience turning the negative weather to the positiveness and teaching
  children shift the way of thinking of negativity. For my first exploration, I
  developed 20 concepts for three natural elements, rain, wind and light. After
  that i narrowed down to one concept for each natural element.

  <h3>Rain</h3>

  Playground is always closed when there is rain. The concept is to developer a
  playground that is activated by the rain. The inspiration comes from my fond
  of listening to raindrop. People pick up a canvas, which has tiltable music
  holders. 7 different Lego brick make music notes when hit by the water flow,
  equipped with wet sensor and speaker. People construct the music instrument by
  putting musical Lego brick onto the holder. The raindrop hitting the canvas
  also make a background music. People can put their canvas in the white zone to
  make a natural melody together with others when it rains

  <h3>Wind</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  People stay inside when there is wind. The idea is to create a playful
  scenario with wind. The inspiration comes from my personal skydiving and
  parachuting experience. First, People build a minifigure and put it on a
  paraglider (figure 11). Then they release the paraglider from a lego mountain
  and control the glider with a remote control (figure 12). Finally, they get a
  landing score (figure 13). They can also compete with others. Children express
  themselves through constructing the minifigures. They learn to understand the
  unruly wind to successfully land the parachute. They also learn to compete
  with other playmates in a playful way. The activity is actively engaging,
  iterative, socially interactive and joyful (The Lego Foundation, 2020). In
  terms of the playful tension (Rahbek, 2020), the paraglider control and the
  landing goal are orderly while wind direction and strength and the freedom of
  controlling paraglider in the air are unruly.

  <h3>Full Play Experience</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  I presented three concepts to Lego House and Lego Foudndation. Together with
  their head of design, we decided on the wind concept because of the conceptâ€™s
  uniqueness and the expected playful learning outcome (figure 14). I developed
  the scene (figure 10) into a more detailed scenario (figure 15). The space is
  exactly based on one of current white zones at Lego House (figure 17). To
  practice 3D modeling skills, i turned the scene in rhino and keyshots (figure
  16). After consultation with workshop manager, I also changed the paraglider
  to a hang glider, which is more stable and easier to make.

  <h3>Hang Glider</h3>
</Title>
<Text title="Iterations">
  The flying part is the key of the play experience. So i focused on developing
  the hang glider. Although the first iteration (figure 18) does not fly, it
  defines the basic elements for the prototype, a Lego minifigure, a hang
  glider, remote control and a motor.I took inspiration from a real hang glider.
  I scaled down the measurements (figure 20) and made a second hang glider
  (figure 19). I used plastics wrap as the wing material. It still could not
  fly. I learned that the wing span is too small for the weight of PLA material.
  In addition, 3D printer has limited volume, so the model has to be printed in
  separate parts and connected after. Therefore, the connection part is fragile
  and easily broken.I changed the frame material to basal wood and used japanese
  tissue paper as wing material (figure 21). I also increased the wing span
  size. It successfully flies but the glider is too small to carry both the
  remote and the minifigure, which weights around 25 grams. Iteration 3
  Iteration 4 This iteration i took inspiration from a toy hang glider, i made a
  hang glider (figure 22) based on the figure 23. To make minifigures and
  electronics safely land, i added structures (figure 24). However, the
  connection point takes a lot impact from the floor when landing. Therefore, i
  added extra support (figure 25) to spread the impact.I tested the hang glider
  by throwing it from different heights (figure 26). The first issue is the
  flight is not long enough to provide a playful experience. In addition, basal
  wood breaks easily due to the electronics weights.To solve the first issue in
  iteration 4, i introduced the propeller (figure 27) so the glider can fly
  longer. Because of the time limit of the project, i chose the rubber band
  powered over the electronics. Although electric motor powered propeller would
  have better performance than the rubber powered one, the rubber propeller
  still proves that the introduction of propeller is a right choice.To solve the
  second issue in iteration 4 and improve the aesthetics, i changed the frame
  from basal wood to PLA material, which largely increases the robustness of the
  prototype. The propeller is also 3D printed to match the aesthetics. Except
  the handles for minifigure were printed at 3mm diameter, the main frame is
  printed at 2mm diameter to minimise the weight. The connection points are the
  fragile areas. Therefore i strengthen them with connectors. The position of
  the motor on the frame is calibrated with multiple tests to make sure the
  weights are balanced.

  I presented my idea to 10 designers from Lego House and staff from Lego
  Foundation and received feedback from different angles.
