<h5>
  Discursive Design: Data physicalisation of invisible barriers faced by foreign
  residents navigating Dutch public systems
</h5>

<Gap margin={200} />

<Text>
  In 2022, 401,351 persons immigrated to the Netherlands(Statistics
  Netherlands,2022). When foreign-born adults navigate the Dutch public system,
  <strong>
    language is often viewed as the visible barrier while beneath the surface
    lies numerous additional invisible barriers stemming from cultural
    differences.
  </strong>

  <strong>
    Weave is a discursive design project encouraging discourse on these
    challenges.
  </strong>
  It aims to raise awareness of invisible barriers faced by foreign residents, especially
  skilled immigrants, and provide a space for audience to gain exposure to information,
  introspect, and engage in discussions.
  <br />
  <br />
  By threading individual responses to each question, people contribute to
  creating a data map, sharing their personal journey of navigating the Dutch
  public system. Upon completion, wearing the special glasses offers a fresh
  perspective, unveiling hidden texts that reveal deeper meanings behind each
  question.

  The first stage centered on the question "What are the underlying barriers
  faced by foreign-residents when they navigating the Dutch public system and
  how are these interconnected at a systemic level?" The activities involved in
  this stage include relation mapping, eight semi-structured interviews with 5
  foreign residents and 3 Dutch residents.

  <h3>Theory behind Questions</h3>
</Title>
<img src="../../../fmp/theory3.png" />
<Text>
  Based on the literature, interviews and personal experience,{" "}
  <strong>
    7 representative questions are chose to visualise the invisible barriers
    that foreign residents experience in the Netherlands
  </strong>
  :<ul>
    <li>How fluent is your Dutch?</li>
    <li>
      How different do you find the Dutch culture compared to your home
      environment?
    </li>
    <li>
      How concerned are you about your current visa status in the Netherlands?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many Dutch locals do you have as close friends in where you live?
    </li>
    <li>
      In challenging situations, such as dealing with tax matters, what is your
      first resource?
    </li>
    <li>How interested are you in discussing Dutch news with others?</li>
    <li>
      How interested are you in participating in Dutch elections if you are
      eligible to do so?
    </li>
  </ul>
</Text>
<Text>
  The theory associated with each question are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>How fluent is your Dutch?</strong>
    </li>{" "}
    The language barrier is visible and the first barrier for foreign-born
    residents. Language is a key vehicle for migrant to access and experience
    services of the host society smoothly and the competency facilitates the
    sense of belonging (Erlinghagen et al., 2021). People generally need to rely
    on others or tools to navigate
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        How different do you find the Dutch culture compared to your home
        environment?
      </strong>
    </li>
    Cultural distance is defined as the degree to which shared norms and values
    differ from one country to another (Hofstede, 2001), which influences the
    design of public service system. Sociocultural adaptation, number of close
    friends and perceived cultural distance are interrelated. The larger the
    difference between two cultures, the migrant needs to expend more cognitive
    efforts in adapting to the difference (Demes & Geeraert, 2014) and is likely
    to have less close friends (Erlinghagen et al., 2021). Meanwhile, 90% of
    cultural characteristics, such as non-verbal communication or values, are
    difficult to identify and easy to ignore (Lachner et al., 2015) and can
    easily become a significant invisible barrier.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        How concerned are you about your current visa status in the Netherlands?
      </strong>
    </li>
    Although most of interview participants are considered as highly skilled
    immigrant, they still reported the fear of dealing with government and the
    insecurity in the system. The possibility of having to leave the country
    without any influence may lead to hesitation in fully engaging in public
    affairs or advocating for the rights due to concerns about the potential
    impact on the visa. The subconscious fear invisibly hindered foreign-born
    residents gain the familiarity with the system through trial and error.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        How many Dutch locals do you have as close friends in where you live?
      </strong>
    </li>
    Friendships are indispensable to individuals’ opportunities and to their
    integration into the society (Erlinghagen et al., 2021). Additionally,
    locals have more information resources within the society. For example,
    locals have more knowledge in applying for benefits and solving certain
    issues, like housing or tax. Having strong social network with the locals
    makes it easier for migrant to navigate the system and have access to
    broader opportunities in the emigration country (Erlinghagen et al., 2021).
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        In challenging situations, such as dealing with tax matters, what is
        your first resource?
      </strong>
    </li>
    Both Dutch and foreign residents struggled with bureaucracy and jargon when
    dealing with taxes. However, many Dutch natives first seek help from
    parents, relatives, partners, or close friends. On the other hand, foreign
    young adults typically translate Dutch documents or search for solutions
    online as their initial response. Migrants, especially new arrivals, are
    less likely to have family and strong ties in the host country. Handling tax
    issues requires support from strong ties due to the sensitive and personal
    nature of the information involved, which might be uncomfortable to share
    with weak ties (Erlinghagen et al., 2021). Failure to address the
    bureaucratic task can lead to feelings of loneliness and powerlessness.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        How interested are you in discussing Dutch news with others?
      </strong>
    </li>
    The significance of the local news is underestimated. Local news is an
    important channel for people to access information source. Keeping update to
    the news and having a social discussion with others are important for people
    to have access to relevant information sources and feel socially connected.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>
        {" "}
        How interested are you in participating in Dutch elections if you are eligible
        to do so?
      </strong>
    </li>
    Although there are legislation prohibiting foreign residents from voting,
    the clause "if you are eligible to do so" was added to focus on the pure
    motivation aspect of voting. This question focuses on connecting with the
    society on a next level, and being represented in the country’s decision
    making. It serves as an end question because all previous answers
    potentially influence the response to this last question.
