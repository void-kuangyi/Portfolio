# Weave

<h5>
  Discursive Design for invisible barriers faced by foreign-born residents
  navigating Dutch public systems
</h5>

<Gap margin={200} />

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  There are 400,000 immigrants coming to the Netherlands every year (CBS,2022).
  In Eindhoven, 21% of residents were born outside the country. When
  foreign-born adults navigate the Dutch public system, language is often viewed
  as the visible barrier while beneath the surface lies numerous additional
  invisible barriers stemming from cultural differences.
  <br />
  <br />
  Weave is a discursive design project encouraging discourse on these challenges.
  It aims to raise awareness of invisible barriers faced by foreign-born residents
  and provide a space for the audience to gain exposure to information, introspect,
  and engage in discussions. By threading individual responses to each question,
  people contribute to creating a data map, sharing their personal journey of navigating
  the Dutch public system. Upon completion, wearing the special glasses offers a
  fresh perspective, unveiling hidden texts that reveal deeper meanings behind each
  question.
  <br />
  <br />
  The project is grounded in research and draws insights from the designer’s
  personal experience as a foreign-born resident in the Netherlands and
  interviews conducted with individuals born inside and outside the country.

  <h3>Research</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  A total of eight participants took part in the interviews, comprising five
  foreign-born residents and three Dutch-born residents. The interviewees were
  encouraged to share their past experiences with public services and express
  their associated emotions. Additionally, the provincial council and waterschap
  election held on March 25th, 2023, were used as a case study to explore the
  participants' perspectives on future planning and uncover underlying barriers
  to political engagement.
  <br />
  <br />
  Drawing upon both the analysis of the interviews and relevant literature on conflict
  analysis (Herbert, 2017), a conflict map was generated. This map highlights a correlation
  between the level of familiarity with the system and the amount of information
  available, which, is influenced by the size of an individual's social network.
  However, due to the unique backgrounds of foreign-born residents, they are more
  likely to expend additional cognitive effort in adapting to the model of the Dutch
  public system. Moreover, the prevalence of homophily acts as a limiting factor
  in the formation of extensive social networks within the host country, thereby
  impeding access to pertinent information.

  <h3>Ideations</h3>

<Text>
  I adopted the 10 modes of message form (Tharp & Tharp, 2016) as an ideation
  methodology.

  The final form is still under development until final demo day, 9th June,
  2023. Below shows the interaction with the low fidelity prototype. The whole
  artefact is 200cm x 59.4cm x 40cm.

  Based on the literature review and interviews implemented, I chose 7 questions
  to visualise the invisible barriers that foreign-born residents experience in
  the Netherlands. These are the questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How fluent is your Dutch?</li>
    <li>
      How different do you find the Dutch culture compared to your home
      environment?
    </li>
    <li>
      How concerned are you about your current visa status in the Netherlands?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many Dutch locals do you have as close friends in where you live?
    </li>
    <li>
      In challenging situations, such as dealing with tax matters, what is your
      first resource?
    </li>
    <li>How interested are you in discussing Dutch news with others?</li>
    <li>
      How interested are you in participating in Dutch elections if you are
      eligible to do so?
    </li>
  </ul>

<Annotation>
  Upon completion, participants have the option to wear special glasses that
  utilise the anaglyph effect, allowing them to uncover hidden texts that reveal
  deeper meanings associated with each question.
</Annotation>
<Text>
  The deeper meaning associated with each question are:
  <ul>
    <li>How fluent is your Dutch?</li> When you are an adult, mastering the
    Dutch language is challenging, especially when having highly demanding work,
    education and/or family responsibilities at the same time.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      How different do you find the Dutch culture compared to your home
      environment?
    </li>
    When your home environment culture differs more from the mainstream social
    culture, it requires more mental energy to understand, adjust to, and find
    comfort within it. Around 90% of cultural characteristics, such as
    non-verbal communication or values, are difficult to identify and easy to
    ignore (Lachner et al., 2015).
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      How concerned are you about your current visa status in the Netherlands?
    </li>
    If you are on a temporary visa, you might feel insecure in the system and
    fear regarding its renewal. The possibility of having to leave the country
    without any influence may lead to a hesitation in fully connecting with
    society. You may also feel hesitant about engaging in public affairs or
    advocating for your rights due to concerns about the potential impact on
    your visa.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      How many Dutch locals do you have as close friends in where you live?
    </li>
    When you have local friends and actively socialise with them, you feel more
    connected and interested in the place you live in.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      In challenging situations, such as dealing with tax matters, what is your
      first resource?
    </li>
    When you don’t have someone local to support and help you in navigating
    bureaucratic tasks, you may feel frustrated and overwhelmed. Whereas, when
    you know someone who can guide you, it feels reassuring and secure.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>How interested are you in discussing Dutch news with others?</li>
    When you are engaged with the news, it means that you are up to date with
    one of the most significant information sources, and being connected to
    society.
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      How interested are you in participating in Dutch elections if you are
      eligible to do so?
    </li>
    When you express interest in participating in dutch elections, it signifies
    that you are actively represented, increasing the likelihood that your voice
    will be heard in policy-making processes and efforts to bring about
    meaningful change.
