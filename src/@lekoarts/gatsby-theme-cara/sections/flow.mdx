<h5>
  Research through Design: How do space-changing elements influence children's
  social interaction in play?
</h5>

<Gap margin={200} />

<Title>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  Play plays a very important role in children’s early life, and they spent
  quite a lot time playing. The recess on the school playground are the main
  context where children can freely structure their own activities and choose
  peers with whom to interact, which forms their social transactions and peer
  relationships. But A lot of our current playground lacks diversity and easily
  favor the play preferences, by the amount of physical exercises they
  emphasise. If we want children to have a wide range of possibilities about how
  they think about themselves and who they can be, we need to provide
  playgrounds that enable a wide variety of play activities, and which do not
  allow particular forms of masculinity to dominate the available space.
  [Paechter and Clark, 2007]
  <br />
  <br />I developed this research project on understanding{" "}
  <b>
    how sizes, layouts, visual transparency, dynamic space changing influence
    children’s social play in a playground
  </b>{" "}
  in order to provide a guideline for developing inclusive playground, and
  generate knowledge for researchers when they research in a school playground
  context.

  <h3>Design Artefacts</h3>

  All the equipment have climbing holes on the wall. Inside the frame hangs
  multiple spinable translucent curtains.

  <h3>Space Design</h3>
</Title>
<h5>A playground from introverts' perspective</h5>
<img src="../../../flow/Space-01.png" />
<Text>
  The design provides space for different needs from children, especially for
  introverted children. They can still be part of a play by being in a close
  proximity while still have space for themselves to relax and unwind.
  <br />
  <b>Social interaction space </b>is where several children come together and
  social encounters and interaction can occur.
  <br />
  <b>Gap space</b> is distance between the child and equipment or between
  children.
  <br />
  <b>Comfort space</b> is spaces near architectural elements that provide
  comfort, in this case, are the equipment to lean against and the enclosure
  area to observe while being “out of the way”. [Tieben, 2015] It is a chill
  area supports relaxation, unwinding or stress relief experience and calmness
  during play.

<Title>
  <h3>Supported Play Types</h3>
</Title>
<h5>Physical play and Fantasy play</h5>
<Text>
The design supports <b>physical play</b>. It offers different running routes for children. Children are supported to play chasing, tag, hide-and-seek,
or other physical games. Children can climb on top of the equipment, jump off or slide down from the top. [Korhonen et
al., 2009]. Children are expected to spin or push through the curtain.

  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Fantasy play </b>can also be elicited through bright colours and shapes. Castle and home are very common objects fantasied by children. The shape is designed abstract because
  playgrounds should typically avoid equipment that is too specifically
  designed, which limits children’s imagination. A simpler structure allows
  more room for pretend play [Fernelius and Christensen, 2017].

  <h3>User Study</h3>

  </Annotation>
  <img src="../../../flow/depth.png" />
  <Annotation>The depth and hole size</Annotation>
  The depth is based on field trip to playgrounds and safety suggestions from
  U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission [1986]. The hole size is based on
  Dutch children's average foot size.

  <h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  <img src="../../../flow/safety1.png" />
  <Annotation>
    Safe tread rise for climbing and tangling proof curtain
  </Annotation>
  The gap between each climbing hole should be less than 14cm to ensure children
  can climb safely. The curtain is made of PVC and it is thick enough so that
  children don’t get tangled with it. The middle of the frame is narrowed for
  better support. All edges are rounded for safeness.

<Text>
  <img src="../../../flow/dynaroll.png" />
  <Annotation>Strong dynaroll connecting curtain to the frame</Annotation>
  The curtain is spinable and connected to the ceiling with ball bearings. It is
  strong enough to hold if children pull the curtain. The smooth texture of PVC
  also prevents children from hanging onto it.{" "}
</Text>

<Title>
  <h3>Manufacturing Considerations</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  The frame is made from recycled plastic, which is sustainable and also easy to
  be mould for a fluid shape. <br />
  <br />
  The curtain material is translucent PVC, 40cm width x 4mm depth, based on
  online suppliers' information.

  <h3>Methods</h3>
</Title>
<h5>Expert Interview and co-constructing stories</h5>
<Text>
  The evaluation was conducted with expert interviews, combined with
  co-constructing stories. Experts are three primary school teachers, one child
  therapist, one parent, and one playground designer.
  <br />
  <br />
  Co-constructing consists of two phases: sensitisation and elaboration. Experts
  were asked about their past experience with 6 - 8 years old and children’s play
  patterns. In the elaboration phase, experts envision the scenarios with the design.[Participatory
  Design Conference et al., 2012]

  <h3>Results</h3>
</Title>

<Text title="Center category vs Margin category">
  <img src="../../../flow/category.png" />
  It has been observed that if a child is <b>
    {" "}
    a boy, old, popular or adventurous
  </b>, they have a higher chance to dominate the playground, this type of group
  will be referred to as the ”centre category” in the following paragraph. However,
  if a child is <b>a girl, young, unpopular or quiet</b>, they have less chances
  to be in the centre of a play circle. This type will be referred to as the ”margin
  category”
</Text>

<Text title="How does the size influence children's play preference?">
  <img src="../../../flow/size.png" />
  <Annotation>Suitable children amount for each design</Annotation>
  The purple castle is designed to fit 5 - 7 children, the blue castle is for 3
  - 4 and the orange home is for 1 - 2. The centre category children are
  expected to play more at bigger ones while the margin category children will
  probably hang out around the orange homes because of the comfort and
  independence provided by its more enclosed features. However, the games
  children manage to come up with different equipment also influence their
  choices of the equipment.

<Text title="How does layout influence children's social interaction?">
  <Images>
    <img src="../../../flow/layout1.png" />
    <img src="../../../flow/layout2.png" />
  </Images>
  <Annotation>Small equipments vs. Big equipments in the center</Annotation>
  <b>Putting the home shape in the centre is double-sided.</b> On one side, it
  simultaneously provides an observation point for the margin category children
  and creates closer proximity between the two categories. Experts acknowledged
  the importance of physical close proximity (for example, how close two
  children sit next to each other in a classroom) when forming a friendship. It
  is assumed that the same principle is applicable in a playground. On the other
  side, being surrounded by the centre category can be intimidating for the
  margin category, which might stop them completely from approaching the play
  area. Therefore,{" "}
  <b>
    an optimal distance that creates enough physical proximity without social
    pressures is yet to be found.
  </b>
</Text>

<Text title="Does transluency create comfort?">
  <img src="../../../flow/transparency.png" />
  <br />
  Unfortunately, children are not expected to have long conversations through
  the holes and translucent curtains. Rather than creating comfort, the features
  actually elicit curiosity from children.
</Text>

<Text title="What if the playground change over time?">
  <img src="../../../flow/dynamic.gif" />
  <Annotation>A playground updated regularly by the school</Annotation>
  <br />A dynamic playground is much preferred from both children and school’s
  perspectives. It brings excitement and inclusion. The domination phenomena of
  equipment is profound. Manufactured equipment can set up uncomfortable power
  relations that influence participation, with certain pieces of equipment being
  dominated by more dominant and sociable children.{" "}
  <b>
    The dynamic playground detaches the invisible control from the centre
    category and empowers the margin category to have the negotiation
    opportunity
  </b>{" "}
  , which provides a positive social interaction [de Valk et al., 2015] and
  improves the inclusion on the playground.
