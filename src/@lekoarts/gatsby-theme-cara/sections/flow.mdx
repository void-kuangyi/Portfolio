<Text title="Introduction">
  Literature and existing frameworks create awareness about the influential
  factors in space but never provide us solutions for how to design for a
  specific context. In this design research project, the school playground is
  chosen as a specific context [Tieben, 2015]
  <br />
  <br />
  In addition, Play plays a very important role in children’s early life, and they
  spent quite a lot time playing. The recess on the school playground are the main
  context where children can freely structure their own activities and choose peers
  with whom to interact, which forms their social transactions and peer relationships.
  But A lot of our current playground lacks diversity and easily favor the play preferences,
  by the amount of physical exercises they emphasise. If we want children to have
  a wide range of possibilities about how they think about themselves and who they
  can be, we need to provide playgrounds that enable a wide variety of play activities,
  and which do not allow particular forms of masculinity to dominate the available
  space. [Paechter and Clark, 2007]
  <br />
  <br />
  I personally experienced exclusion on playground when i was young, just
  because I was a girl and boys did not want to include me in their activities
  even I wanted to. I empathise with children who are less sociable, get
  excluded on a school playground. Even they might not want the social
  interaction, for example, autistic children, the social interaction is still
  vital for their cognitive, motor and emotional skill development.
  <br />
  <br />
  So i developed this research project on understanding how space-changing elements
  (sizes, layouts, visual transparency, dynamic space changing) influence children’s
  social play in order to provide a guideline for developing inclusive playground,
  and generate knowledge for researchers when they research in a school playground
  context.

  <h3>Final Design</h3>
</Title>
<ImageText src="../../../flow/design.png">
  The design is composed with three different shapes, purple castle, blue castle
  and orange home. All the equipment have climbing holes on the wall. Inside the
  frame hangs multiple spinable translucent curtains.The purple castle is
  designed to fit 5 - 6 children, the blue castle is for 3 - 4 and the orange
  home is for 1 - 2. The number is based on children running through without
  feeling crowded.

  The design is designed as a social interaction space with objects where
  several children come together and social encounters and interaction can occur
  . Simultaneously, gap spaces are distance between the child and equipment or
  between children. Comfort spaces are spaces near architectural elements that
  provide comfort [Tieben, 2015], in this case, are the equipment to lean
  against and the enclosure area to observe while being “out of the way”.
  <br />
  <br />
  The design supports physical play. The layouts of the design offer different running
  routes for children. Children are supported to play chasing, tag, hide-and-seek,
  or other common physical games. Children can climb on top of the equipment and
  then either jump off or slide down from the top. Different heights of the design
  develop and exercise children’s skills in a challenging situation [Korhonen et
  al., 2009]. Children are expected to spin or push through the curtain.
  <br />
  <br />
  In addition, fantasy play can also be elicited through the bright colours and
  the shapes like castles and homes. Castle and home were reported to be the
  most common fantasy shapes. The shape is also designed abstract because
  playgrounds should typically avoid equipment that is too specifically
  designed, which limits children’s imagination and a simpler structure allows
  more room for pretend play [Fernelius and Christensen, 2017]. The design also
  provide children a chill area under the frame, supporting relaxation,
  unwinding or stress relief experience and calmness during play [Korhonen et
  al., 2009].

  <img src="../../../flow/sketch.png" />
  The height is based on the tallest dutch children (144cm) and the average dutch
  children (130cm) and short dutch children (120cm). Width is based on the widest
  waist width for 6 years and the widest waist width for 8 years. The depth is based
  on a field trip to a playground, mea- suring common width for ladders and also
  safety suggestions from U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission[1986]. The hole
  size is 8 x 6cm (width x height) based on the average foot size of 6 - 8 years
  old in the Netherlands. The gap between each hole is less than 14cm based on and
  measuring common tread rise and U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission[1986].
  <br />
  <br />
  The frame is made from recycled plastic, which is sustainable and also easy to
  be mould for a fluid shape. The curtain material is translucent PVC, 40cm x
  4mm (width x depth), based on online supplier information. The usage of PVC
  material makes sure that children don’t get tangled with it. The curtain is
  spinable and connected to the ceiling with ball bearings, which are strong
  enough to hold mul- tiple children hanging on it. The smooth texture of PVC
  also prevents children from hanging. The middle of the frame is narrowed for
  better support. All edges are rounded for safeness.
  <br />
  <br />
  The colour choices are inspired by a visit to a toy store in Eindhoven. In addition,
  orange is generally associated with warmth, which matches the home shape. Purple
  usually means mystery, which fits with the castle fantasy.

  <h3>Methods</h3>
</Title>
<Text>
  The study was conducted with expert interviews, combined with co-constructing
  stories. The expert interview provides exclusive insights into comprehensive
  knowledge about 6 - 8 years old children quickly and easily [Monke, 2021].
  Expert 1 is a retired primary school teacher with a permanent teaching
  position for 35 years. Expert 2 is a child therapist and currently has three 6
  - 8 years clients. Expert 3 is a primary school teacher 5 years of teaching
  experience. Expert 4 is a parent for a 7 year old son. Expert 5 is a primary
  school teacher with 32 years of teaching experience.
  <br />
  <br />
  Co-constructing consists of two phases: sensitisation and elaboration. The sensitisation
  phase aims to make participants think about their past experiences. In this case,
  experts were asked about their past experience with 6 - 8 years old and the observation
  of children’s play patterns so that in the elaboration phase the experts can better
  envision the scenarios with the design. The second phase starts with introducing
  the design in an envisaged context. [Participatory Design Conference et al., 2012].
  Interview were recorded, transcribed and analysed with hybrid deductive and inductive
  coding.
